# Objects

Objects each live in their own folder with a description README (with credits/etc). In most cases objects should live in a .blend scene instead of as a raw mesh file (dae/stl/obj...). This is to ensure materials and URDF-related properties are transferred to scenes correctly.

See `object_README.md` for a template description file.
